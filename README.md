# Quiz 8 Imaging & Coding Inspiration
**Name:** Yujian Li  
**Artist Chosen:** Keith Haring

## Part 1 Imaging Technique Inspiration
Keith Haring’s art inspires me because of his bold lines, bright colors, and simple human shapes. His works feel movement and life. I like how he turns everyday actions and emotions into powerful visual symbols. For my project, I want to use a similar line style and limited color to show human energy and connection. I think this technique is great because it’s fun, expressive, and easy for people to understand.

## Part 2 Coding Technique Exploration (p5.js)
The p5.js video shows how to create flowing and animated lines using `beginShape()` 、 `vertex()` and `noise()`.The lines move smoothly and look almost alive, which reminds me of Keith Haring’s strong sense of rhythm and motion. His drawings always feel like they are moving. I want to use this technique to make Haring’s lines actually move on the screen. By using p5.js to add motion, I can bring more energy and life to my design, making it feel as dynamic and playful as his original artworks.
